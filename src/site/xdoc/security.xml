        <section name="Secure Mode">
          <p>It is possible to run RSB in secure mode where only authorized users can use certain applications</p>
          <p>This is done by doing the following:</p>
          <ul>
           <li>Activate security by uncommenting the blocks title "Uncomment to enable security" in <b>web.xml</b> and <b>security-beans.xml</b></li>
           <li>Configure a Spring Security authentication provider in <b>security-beans.xml</b> to retrieve users from LDAP, Database...</li>
           <li>Configure RSB to associate applications with users and/or roles authorized to act as application users and admins, as shown in the next section.</li>
           <li>Optionally configure users and/or roles authorized to act as RSB admins, as shown in the following section.</li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="Application Level Security">
          <p>The following demonstrate how to configure RSB application level security:</p>
          <pre>
    "applicationSecurityConfiguration": {
      "secure_app_1": {
        "userPrincipals":["bob","dan"]
      },
      "secure_app_2": {
        "userRoles":["ROLE_SCIENTIST","ROLE_ANALYST"]
      },
      "secure_app_3": {
        "userPrincipals":["bob","dan"],
        "userRoles":["ROLE_SCIENTIST","ROLE_ANALYST"]
      },
      "secure_app_4": {
        "userPrincipals":["bob","dan"],
        "userRoles":["ROLE_SCIENTIST","ROLE_ANALYST"],
        "functionCallAllowed": true,
        "scriptSubmissionAllowed": true
      },
      "secure_app_5": {
        "userPrincipals":["bob","dan"],
        "userRoles":["ROLE_SCIENTIST","ROLE_ANALYST"],
        "adminPrincipals":["jack"],
        "adminRoles":["ROLE_ADMIN"]
      }
    }
          </pre>
          <p>Application admins, declared with <b>adminPrincipals</b> and <b>adminRoles</b> are de-facto users of the concerned application.</p>
          <p>Notice how the <b>functionCallAllowed</b> and <b>scriptSubmissionAllowed</b> attributes are used to explicitly allow the users of <i>secure_app_4</i> to execute jobs that can potentially impact the environment where R executes. This is disabled by default. Application admins are not affected by these flags.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="RSB Admin Security">
          <p>The following demonstrate how to configure the optional RSB admin roles/groups:</p>
          <pre>
    "rsbSecurityConfiguration": {
        "adminPrincipals":["joe"],
        "adminRoles":["ROLE_ADMIN"]
    }
          </pre>
          <p><b>RSB admins are de-facto users and admins of all the applications</b>.</p>
        </section>
        <section name="Application Aware Catalog">
          <p>In a secure environment, it can be desirable to partition the catalog per application name.
          This prevents one application or one application admin to read or write files in another application.</p>
          <p>This option, which is off by default, is activated with the following configuration setting:</p>
          <pre>
    "applicationAwareCatalog" : true
          </pre>
        </section>
    </body>
